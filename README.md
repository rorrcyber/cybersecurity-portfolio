Cybersecurity projects, reports, and tools by Richard Orr

## 🔐 About Me
I'm a Red Team and Blue Team practitioner focused on real-world offensive security testing, SOC operations, and cloud defense strategies. With hands-on experience in AWS, Splunk, Burp Suite, Nessus, and Wireshark, I build and test secure environments using both attacker and defender mindsets.

## 📁 Portfolio Highlights
- **Red Team**: Brute force attacks using Burp Suite & Hydra, SQL injection via DVWA, and reverse shell detection.
- **Blue Team**: Splunk dashboards and alerting for brute force & malware activity; Wireshark traffic analysis.
- **AWS Security**: EC2 scans, IAM policy hardening, and SIEM integration.
- **Certifications**: Security+, Red Team training, SOC analysis labs (TryHackMe, Hack The Box).
